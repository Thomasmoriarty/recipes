    <p>cooking instructions</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the sheep's stomach thoroughly under cold water, then soak it in salted water overnight. Rinse again before using.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the chopped sheep's heart, liver, and suet.</li>
        <li>Add the finely chopped onions and oatmeal to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Season the mixture with salt, ground black pepper, coriander, nutmeg, mace, and dried mixed herbs. Mix well to combine.</li>
        <li>Stuff the mixture into the prepared sheep's stomach, filling it about two-thirds full. Be sure to leave room for expansion during cooking.</li>
        <li>Sew the opening of the stomach closed with a needle and thread, or use skewers to secure it.</li>
        <li>Place the stuffed stomach in a large pot and pour the beef or lamb stock over it.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a lid and bring the stock to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for about 3 hours, or until the haggis is cooked through and firm to the touch.</li>
        <li>Remove the haggis from the pot and allow it to cool slightly before serving.</li>
        <li>To serve, slice the haggis and serve it with neeps (mashed turnips) and tatties (mashed potatoes), traditionally accompanied by a whisky sauce.</li>
      </ol>
